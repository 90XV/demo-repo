# Hi!

Welcome to my demo GitHub repository! I have created this repo to learn the ins and outs of using Git as I think that it is very useful for when I wanna keep my code available any where and clonable too!

I've added another line!


## Subheader

This is a text testing line.

remember these few things ok 

git status - to check whether there are new files
git add . - to recognize all new files added
git commit -m "title" -m "Desc" - to commit these changes to the repo and add a title and desc to the commit
git push origin master/main depending on the name of the repo eg: demo-repo (main) or demo-repo2 (master)

remember to change directory (cd) when working in multiple folders to make sure that the commits are correct
cd ../name of repo/
